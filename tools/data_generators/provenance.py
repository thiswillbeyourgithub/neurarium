"""Source provenance: grades, corpora registry, and the source validators.

Every source / reference the viewer shows carries a ``provenance`` grade (llm /
sourced / verified). This module holds the grade vocabulary, the per-id override
registries, the ``SOURCE_CORPORA`` citation registry, and the validators that
normalize + check every quote-level source (drug bindings, Ki annotations,
expression locations). Kept dependency-free so any data module can import it.

# Source provenance grades. Every source / reference the viewer shows carries a
# ``provenance`` level saying *how trustworthy its attribution is*, rendered as a
# small coloured pill (the palette + tooltips live in the viewer; the grade here
# is the data). Weakest to strongest:
#   "llm"      grey   - produced by an LLM from memory, unchecked against any
#                       document, so it may be a hallucination.
#   "sourced"  yellow - written by an LLM that was given the source document
#                       (e.g. the Stahl dump), but the specific claim was not
#                       quote-verified.
#   "verified" green  - an LLM extracted a quote, the quote was programmatically
#                       confirmed to be present in the source, and a separate LLM
#                       agreed it supports the claim. (Still LLM-driven, so not
#                       infallible: see the viewer tooltip; going further would
#                       need substantial, error-prone human review, out of scope.)
